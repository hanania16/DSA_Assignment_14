## Project Overview

This project contains Java implementations of **three advanced Data Structures and Algorithms problems**, focusing on **real-world system simulations**:

1. **Shell Command History System**
2. **Memory Block Manager (Mark–Sweep Garbage Collection)**
3. **VIP Spender Tracker (Top-K Problem)**

Each problem is implemented in a **separate folder** with clear structure, documentation, and sample executions.

## Concepts Covered

* Dynamic Arrays (`ArrayList`)
* Hash Tables (`HashMap`)
* Stacks (DFS Traversal)
* Linked Lists (Free List)
* Min-Heaps (Top-K Tracking)
* Garbage Collection (Mark–Sweep)
* Command Parsing & Simulation

## How to Compile and Run

Navigate into any problem folder and run:

```bash
javac src/*.java
java src.Main
```

Example:

```bash
cd Problem_27_Shell_History
javac src/*.java
java src.Main
```

## Documentation

Each problem folder contains its own `README.md` explaining:

* Problem description
* Data structures used
* Algorithm design
* Time & space complexity
* File responsibilities

---

## Features

* Modular and readable Java code
* Proper use of DSA concepts
* Command-line interaction
* Well-documented structure
* Easy to test and extend

---

## Conclusion

This assignment demonstrates the practical application of **Data Structures and Algorithms** to solve real-world inspired problems using **Java**.
The implementations prioritize correctness, efficiency, and clarity.
